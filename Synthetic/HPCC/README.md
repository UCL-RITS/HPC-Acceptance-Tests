# HPC Challenge benchmark

This acceptance test involves running the HPC Challenge benchmark.  For the purposes of scoring, your result will be the sustained HPL Linpack performance (`Rmax`) of an "optimised" (or if you prefer but that seems unlikely "base") run.  Please provide the results for the other parts of the benchmark for information purposes.

Please put your projected `Rmax` score fore the entire solution as it will be delivered into the testing spreadsheet.
