# GROMACS benchmark

To aid with standardisation across UK HPC systems, our GROMACS benchmark is identical to the "large" one used by ARCHER, the UK national HPC service.

Details of how to build and run the benchmark may be found in the ARCHER repository here: https://github.com/hpc-uk/archer-benchmarks/tree/master/apps/GROMACS

For the purposes of scoring in UCL procurements, the important result is the performance in nanoseconds/day.

At UCL the most recent version of GROMACS installed on our services is 2018.3.
