# HPC-Acceptance-Tests
Open repository of test scripts for future procurements.

In previous procurements our selection of tests has been reasonable but arbitrary.  This repository will hold a standard set of acceptance test scripts which can be shared with vendors etc. ahead of time.

## Proposed categories:

 * Synthetic (HPCC, Bonnie++, IOR etc.)

 * Applications (VASP, GROMACS, CP2K, LAMMPS)
